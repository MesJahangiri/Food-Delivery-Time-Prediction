# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction
Food delivery time prediction using machine learning models and real-world delivery data

## Overview
This project presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting food delivery time using real-world delivery data. The goal is to estimate the total delivery duration based on order details, restaurant characteristics, customer location, and preparation time.

The project covers the full data science workflow, including data cleaning, feature engineering, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Multiple regression and ensemble models are implemented and compared to identify the most effective approach for this prediction task.
